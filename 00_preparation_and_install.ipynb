    "## What is a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, virtual environments (also called virtualenvs) are tools used to keep projects separate, especially in terms of keeping different software versions separate and different library versions separate. For example, virtualenvs prevent Python's site packages folder from getting filled with potentially conflicting versions of software AND thus prevents problems that arise when one project needs **version x.x** of a library but another project needs **version y.y** of the same library. At their core, virtualenvs are glorified directories that use scripts and metadata to organize and control the environment. You are allowed to have an essentially unlimited number of virtual environments. And as you saw above, they are very easy to create using various command line tools, such as `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When should we use a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you have more than one project and there is a possibility of conflicts between your libraries, it is a good time to use a virtual environment. Having said that, many programmers use virtual environments for **all but the most trivial** programming tasks. Especially for beginners, using virtual environmentss early on in your learning career will build a valuable skill AND help prevent sneaky bugs related to version discrepancies. Bugs that can be hard to diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you create a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",

    "**NOTE**: for other projects, you **can** use `python=2` or `python=3` and regardless which you choose, conda will default to the most recent version of Python within the version 2 OR version 3 family. If you need to select a specific minor version of python, use the following syntax:\n",
